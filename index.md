## About Me

Hi! I'm a third-year PhD student at the <a href='https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/'>UMass Amherst NLP Lab</a>, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/'>Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a> with a research focus on NLP. Before starting my PhD, I finished my undergrad at Smith College with a major in CS and a minor in Math. My current research interests include but are not restricted to:

- Enabling language models to better follow instructions given long inputs.
- Building more robust and challenging benchmarks for long-context language models.
- LLM watermarking and detection.

I like **gaming** and tinkering with **mechanical keyboards** in the free time I aggregate from my fluctuating work-life balance (it's a work in progress ┐(‘～` )┌).
