## About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD student at the <a href='https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/'>UMass Amherst NLP Lab</a>, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/'>Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a> with a research focus on NLP. Before starting my PhD, I did my undergrad at Smith College with a major in CS and a minor in Math. My research interests include but are not restricted to:

- Evaluating and improving the coherence of model-generated text in both short-form and long-form settings.
- Enabling language models to better follow instructions with long inputs.
- LLM watermarking and detection.

I like **gaming** and tinkering with **mechanical keyboards** in the free time I aggregate from my fluctuating work-life balance (it's a work in progress ┐(‘～` )┌).
