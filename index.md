## About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD student at the <a href='http://www.cs.umd.edu/'>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/'>Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a> with a research focus on NLP. Prior to transferring to UMD, I was affiliated with the <a href='https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/'>UMass Amherst NLP Lab</a>, where I was also advised by Prof. Iyyer. My current research interests include but are not limited to:

- Enabling language models to better follow instructions given long inputs
- Building more robust and challenging benchmarks for long-context language models
- LLM watermarking and detection

I like **gaming** and tinkering with **mechanical keyboards** in the free time I aggregate from my fluctuating work-life balance (it's a work in progress ┐(‘～` )┌).

## Latest Timeline

- **[May 2025]** Released [BLEUBERI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11080) preprint, which shows that simple string-matching metrics like BLEU can be used as effective rewards for improving instruction following with GRPO, and can even match the performance of large reward models.
- **[Feb. 2025]** Released our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14854) on a compression-based synthetic data generation pipeline for long-context narrative reasoning tasks.
