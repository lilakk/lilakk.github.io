## About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD student at the <a href='http://www.cs.umd.edu/'>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/'>Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a> with a research focus on NLP. Prior to transferring to UMD, I was affiliated with the <a href='https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/'>UMass Amherst NLP Lab</a>, where I was also advised by Prof. Iyyer. My current main research interests include:

- Reliable / cost-effective metrics for LLM training [[BLEUBERI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11080) (NeurIPS'25)] and evaluation [[BooookScore](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7Ttk3RzDeu) (ICLR'24)]
- Scalable pipelines for model evaluation and training based on synthetic data [[CLIPPER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14854) (COLM'25)] or rewriting the web [[How2everything](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08808) (preprint)].

I like **gaming** and tinkering with **mechanical keyboards** in the free time I aggregate from my fluctuating work-life balance (it's a work in progress ┐(‘～` )┌).

## Updates

- **[Feb 2026]** Released [How2Everything](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08808), a web-scale framework mining step-by-step procedures across diverse domains + a reliable scoring protocol for scalable evaluation and RL-based improvement of step-by-step generation.
- **[Dec 2025]** [Olmo3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11080) is out! All code, training data, and intermediate model checkpoints are publicly available.
- **[Jul 2025]** Invited talk at the Google Multilinguality Reading Group.
- **[Jun 2025]** Started my internship at [Ai2](https://allenai.org/) (OLMo team), working with [Kyle Lo](https://kyleclo.com/) & [Luca Soldaini](https://soldaini.net/)!
- **[May 2025]** Released [BLEUBERI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11080), which shows that simple string-matching metrics like BLEU can be used as effective rewards to improve general instruction following.
- **[Jan. 2025]** Moved to UMD, College Park! Also got my MS degree from UMass Amherst.
- **[Oct. 2024]** ✈ Attended [COLM](https://2024.colmweb.org/) to present [FABLES](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YfHxQSoaWU), a paper on faithfulness evaluation in book-length summarization.
- **[May 2024]** ✈ Attended [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024) and gave an oral presentation for [BooookScore](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7Ttk3RzDeu), a paper on book-length summarization and finegrained coherence evaluation.
- **[Sep. 2022]** Started my PhD!
