## About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst <a href='https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/'>NLP Lab</a>, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/'>Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a> with a research focus on natural language processing (NLP). My past work is mainly about evaluating and improving the **coherence** of model-generated text in both short-form and long-form settings, and my current interest lies in **LLM watermarking and detection**. Before starting my PhD, I finished my undergraduate studies at Smith College with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I've also worked as a Software Engineer intern at Amazon.

I like **gaming** and tinkering with **mechanical keyboards** in the free time I aggregate from my fluctuating work-life balance (it's a work in progress ┐(‘～` )┌).
